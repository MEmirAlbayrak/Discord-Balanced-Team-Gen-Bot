# Random-Balanced-Team-Gen-Bot


# :ghost: What it does ?  
This bot splits all players into 2 teams according to their ranking. The purpose is to generate 2 teams with equal power (fair) to compete in a game.
The algorithm tries to adjust the total power of the teams which is calculated by simply summing up the levels of all players in each team.

# :wrench: Usage :
```
!vs [Player 1 Name] [Player 1 Rank] [Player 2 Name] [Player 2 Rank]...
```
